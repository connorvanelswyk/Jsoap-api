# LambdaSOAP
Put SOAP to REST with AWS Lambda for Java 8

LambdaSOAP is a Java library and a serverless application to perform [SOAP][soap] messaging through a [REST][rest]-ful interface.

Source can be built into a java archive and used as a generic serverless [AWS Lambda function][aws-lambda].

Complex requests can be made by specifying a public URL to locate an example request.

Primitive responses are interpreted as String values and checks for encoding.

Complex responses can be interpreted and marshalled into objects through extension [over modification.][open-closed]
